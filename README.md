# 🔗 Short URL Maker

A simple, client-side URL shortener built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool allows users to input a long URL and receive a shorter, shareable version. The shortened URLs are stored in the browser's `localStorage` and redirect automatically when visited.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Shorten any URL with one click  
- ✅ Auto-copy short URL to clipboard  
- ✅ Instant redirection using hash and localStorage  
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive interface  
- ✅ Works entirely offline — no backend required

---

## 🧠 Important Note

⚠️ This app uses the browser's **localStorage**, so it only works on the same **device and browser** where the short link was created.  
Short URLs will **not** work on another mobile device or browser.

---

## 📦 Usage

### 1. Open `index.html` in your browser

No installation needed. Just double-click the file or serve it with a local server.
